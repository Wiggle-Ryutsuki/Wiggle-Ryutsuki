If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

ANS: A listeners audio aura is determined by the average energy, valence, and danceability, of their lists.
If there is a mix of colors in the aura, we could infer that each color would be related to the individual values of the attributes.
We could assign the range of averages to be categorized as "high", "medium", or "low", and these ranges could be assigned with with a color.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

ANS: There would only be 3 repeating colors if we assign colors only to the range of "high, medium, "low".
Say if the listerners song tastes change, the output of the audio aura won't change too much because of the repeating colors.
Perhaps the range of energy, valence, and danceability, could be split into moods like "passion, romantic, rebellious" with sets of colors corresponding inside those moods,
Then the range of highest to lowest of the average values themselves correspond to how much of which color to output.
