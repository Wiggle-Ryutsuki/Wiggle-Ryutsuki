sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Although it had similar runtimes to sort3, it was quite slower by at least 0.1 seconds.
                  But when it ran on the sorted problems, especially sorted50000.txt, it was faster.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: This took the shortest amount of time to sort out of all three.
                  This was especially visible during the problems with 50000 numbers â€” sort1 and sort3 would take at least 1 second or more, whereas sort2 stays under 1 second.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: It was slower than sort2 but slightly faster than sort1.
